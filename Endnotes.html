    <ul>
      <li>Artifact 1: Argumentative Essay - I decided to do this because I feel as though I am good at writing argumentative essays, 
        and feel as though they are a good outlet for the influence of an audience. For this artifact I used all six resources listed in the bibliography.
      </li>
      <li>Artifact 2: Editorial Article - I decided to do this because I like trying to persouade people through writing, and I because I needed a functional piece. This artifact serves both desires. 
      For this artifact I used four resouces: School Funding Inequities: A Statistical Analysis
     Examining the Adequacy of Funding for Capital Outlay in North Carolina
     Schools", "Making America #1 in Education with Three Reforms", "Dividing Lines: The Role School District Boundaries Play in
     Spending Inequality for Public Education", and "SCHOOL FUNDING: INEQUALITY in DISTRICT FUNDING AND THE
     DISPARATE IMPACT on URBAN AND MIGRANT SCHOOL CHILDREN."
      </li>
      <li>Artifact 3: Comic Strip - I decided to make this artifact because I like comics a lot. They are a coll medium to work with. 
        I didn't directly use any resources, but I gained heavy inspiration from "SCHOOL FUNDING: INEQUALITY in DISTRICT FUNDING AND THE
     DISPARATE IMPACT on URBAN AND MIGRANT SCHOOL CHILDREN." This source explains, among other things, the problem with performance based funding, which ties in with the joke of this comic.</li>
      <li>Artifact 4: Editorial Cartoon - I decided to make this because, I think cartoons are a cool medium to deliver messages. I didn't directly use any resource, but I took
      inspiration from "SCHOOL FUNDING: INEQUALITY in DISTRICT FUNDING AND THE
     DISPARATE IMPACT on URBAN AND MIGRANT SCHOOL CHILDREN", "School Funding Inequities: A Statistical Analysis
     Examining the Adequacy of Funding for Capital Outlay in North Carolina
     Schools", and "Making America #1 in Education with Three Reforms." 
     These sources explained the faults of performance based funding and how increasing funding increases performances and lowers gaps between school.
     The symbolism in this piece reflects that. </li>
